# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Error: Missing $sort after $group
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: omitting the `$sort` stage after `$group`.  The lack of sorting can lead to unpredictable results when using stages like `$limit` or `$skip` that depend on a defined order.

The `bug.js` file contains code with the error, showcasing the unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.js` file presents the corrected code with the necessary `$sort` stage added, ensuring consistent and predictable results.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the MongoDB shell.
3. Create sample data. 
4. Execute the code in `bug.js` and observe the unordered output.
5. Execute the code in `bugSolution.js` and observe the correct, ordered output.

## Solution
Always include a `$sort` stage after the `$group` stage in your aggregation pipeline if you require a specific ordering in the result set, especially when using `$limit` or `$skip`.
